## Why?
UX has become an essential part of technology teams, yet online research tools are cost-prohibitive for many small organizations and individuals. Simple UX's mission is to provide powerful, to-the-point tools for UX researchers at whatever price point you can afford. 

Simple UX is being developed in the open with complete transparency. This project is sponsor-ware, if you like it, please support it.
